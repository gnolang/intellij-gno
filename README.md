## Installation

To install this plugin in IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gnolang/intellij-gno.git
    ```

2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.

3. Build the plugin with Gradle:

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed, IntelliJ IDEA will automatically recognize `.gno` files. You can create new `.gno` files or open existing ones, and the plugin will provide syntax highlighting and basic language support.

### Create a New Gno File

1. Right-click on a directory in the **Project** view.
2. Select **New > File**.
3. Name your file with a `.gno` extension (e.g., `myfile.gno`).
4. Start writing your Gno code!

## Development
